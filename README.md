## Contract Deployments

### Goerli test network

You can see the deployment address of the smart contracts in the [deployments/goerli](deployments/goerli) folder. For
every deployed smart contract you will find a `<smart_contract>.json` JSON file with the address in the `"address"`
field.

#### Configuration

- `Owner`: [`0x3c8D9f130970358b7E8cbc1DbD0a1EbA6EBE368F`](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/address/0x3c8D9f130970358b7E8cbc1DbD0a1EbA6EBE368F/transactions)

The `owner` is allowed to mint SBTs.

- `BASE_URI`: https://beta.metadata.masa.finance/v1.0

The base url for the Metadata url that is beeing generated from the contract

## Roles

- `deployer`: Deploys the contract, has no rights after everything has properlty handed over to other roles
- `owner`: Delegated to the Masa Service account inside the Masa API. It has the rights to administrate the smart
  contracts
- `minter`: Minter role. It has the rights to mint tokens to customers wallets.

## Deployment

### Preparations

* Set `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` to the deployers private key in `.env.{network}.secret`
* Set `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` to the Infura API key in `.env`, if needed
* Set `INFURA_API_KEY` to the Infura API key in `.env`, if needed
* Set `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` to the Infura API key in `.env`, if needed

### Deploy

Run: `yarn deploy --network {network}` to deploy.

## Installation and usage

Installing via `npm` package:

```bash
npm i @masa-finance/masa-contracts-identity
```

Import in your project:

```typescript
import { SoulboundIdentity, SoulboundIdentity__factory } from "@masa-finance/masa-contracts-identity";

const soulboundIdentity: SoulboundIdentity = SoulboundIdentity__factory.connect(
  <address>, // address of the deployed contract
  <provider> // web3 provider
);
console.log(await soulboundIdentity.symbol());
```

## Generation of a new release

From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
yarn release
```

The task does the following:

* Bumps the project version in `package.json`
* Creates a Git tag
* Commits and pushes everything
* Creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
* Git tag push will trigger a GitHub Action workflow to do a `npm` release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. You can add this
environment variable to the `.env` file. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)
